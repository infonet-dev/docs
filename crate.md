# crate

Crate is a library that contains the tools required to facilitate communication. It standardizes how we read/write from/to the registrar and stream metrics.
Crate also provides a caching mechanism for quickly verifying node/sensor registration as well as all the lightweight external objects / commonly used methods to streamline and standardize application behavior. 

To read more about the crate library please see its [README](https://github.com/infonet-dev/crate/blob/main/README.md)
