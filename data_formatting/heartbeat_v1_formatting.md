## Formatting

Heartbeat V1 formatting is as follows
```
{
   "heartbeat": "AAA340e9-3841-4ab1-a6ca-c9b72d07528b"
}
```

Different hardware controllers will have ranged and boolean inputs depending on what they are. This V1 action takes a double value and it is up to the endpoint to decide how to reason about what to do with the value.
